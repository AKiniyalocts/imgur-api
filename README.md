# imgur-api
An open sourced imgur api for Android. (WIP)

# Plan
Create a simple library mirroring the availble api endpoints from <a href="https://api.imgur.com/">imgur</a> for use in Android.
We'll use <a href="http://square.github.io/retrofit/">Retrofit</a> to create our REST client, and then go from there.

# Include in your project
This project is under heavy development, because of this, only snapshots will be availble until a release client is ready.

`repositories {
	    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
	}`
	
`dependencies {
      compile 'com.github.AKiniyalocts:imgur-api:-SNAPSHOT'
}`
